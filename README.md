**Linear Regression from Scratch**

This project demonstrates **Linear Regression** implemented from scratch using **PyTorch**. The model predicts a **continuous output** based on an **input feature** by learning the **best-fit straight line**.

###  **Whatâ€™s Included:**  
- Defined a **Linear Regression Model** using PyTorch.  
- Implemented **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** loss function.  
- Optimized using **Mini-Batch Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)**.  
- Visualized the results with a **best-fit line graph**.

###  **What I Learned:**  
- This implementation was inspired by concepts learned from **d2l.ai**.  
- However, the model was **rebuilt independently from scratch** without directly referencing code examples.

###  **Goal:**  
Understand the **mathematics** and **implementation details** behind **Linear Regression** while gaining hands-on experience with **PyTorch**.
